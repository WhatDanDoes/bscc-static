        <h1>FairShare</h1>
<h1>What's it all about?</h1>
<p>FairShare sets new expectations about work and collaboration.</p>
<p>It is project driven, outcome focused, and designed to produce repeatable results.</p>
<p>Ownership of the final FairShare product rests in the hands of its contributors.</p>
<h2>It's about ownership</h2>
<p>FairShare, at its core, is about the opportunity to keep a piece of what you put in.</p>
<p>When you contribute to a FairShare project - whether with money or time - you may claim a share equal with the value contributed.</p>
<p>With your share of a project comes rights to its sale and marketing. You can even permanently sell your shares.</p>
<h2>It's about collaboration</h2>
<p>FairShares provide a powerful voice. As a FairShare holder, you are entitled to vote on how to see a project through to completion. You may also delegate authority to an elected board of directors.</p>
<p>FairShare projects set new expectations of organizations and how contributors collaborate.</p>
<h2>It's about incentivizing participation</h2>
<p>A contractor working on a FairShare project has no obligation to accept FairShares as payment.</p>
<p>Upon fulfilling a commitment to the DAO, a contractor may take payment in the blockchain's native token, in FairShares, or some percentage of each.</p>
<h2>It's project driven</h2>
<p>Every FairShare project is organized as a <em>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</em>. With each new project comes a new DAO.</p>
<h2>It's about repeatable results</h2>
<p>The FairShare approach to project execution naturally documents workflows. This provides valuable experience when launching similar projects, without binding future decision making.</p>
<p>With each completed FairShare project, whether successful or not, comes a complete record of every conversation that took place.</p>
<h2>It's about optimization</h2>
<p>With comprehensive record-keeping comes an opportunity to simplify processes and correct mistakes for when the next FairShare project is launched.</p>
<p>Future FairShare projects are informed by those of the past, but without binding their decisions in the future.</p>
