        <p>Wearable computational devices provide a powerful means with which to collect data. Though there are many devices to choose from, those manufactured by <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/health/business-solutions/research/">Garmin</a> are especially well-suited for researchers interested in health and wellness. Of the features Garmin tailors to researchers specifically, these are the most compelling:</p>
<h2>High Resolution Raw Data</h2>
<p>Garmin devices allow researchers to define how much data is collected and the intervals at which data is logged. This is significant because some research may benefit from a continuous stream of information, while other inquiries may only require a daily reporting of tabulated data.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Sensor Data</h2>
<p>The <em>high resolution data</em> feature described above is enabled by real-time data collection. Though more data is not necessarily <em>better</em>, the researcher is not bound by limitations in the amount of data that can potentially be collected for analysis.</p>
<h2>Independent Hosting</h2>
<p>This is the most significant feature of all. While data collection faciliates research, independent hosting empowers the research participant. With Garmin devices, participant data never needs to be collected or stored by a third party. Potential subjects can make informed decisions about their participation knowing precisely what data they'll provide and how it will be stored and handled.</p>
<h2>Networking and Data Collection Costs</h2>
<p>Assuming real-time data collection is desirable, a mobile internet connection will be required. The <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/p/698632/pn/010-02383-00">Forerunner 445 LTE</a> is an example of one suitable device.</p>
<p>For a hypothetical year-long study with 60 participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearable hardware costs: 60 x $780 (retail) = $46,800</li>
<li><em>Unlimited</em> cellular data plans (corporate rate quoted by Wow! Mobile 2022-11-24): 60 x 35 x 12 = $25,200</li>
<li>Estimated supporting server hardware and software = $15,000</li>
<li>Estimated facility rental, leasing = $6,000</li>
<li>Estimated high-speed network access = $7,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate total cost for one year of data collection: <strong>$100,000</strong></p>
