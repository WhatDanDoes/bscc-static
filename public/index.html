        <h1>Some say blockchain is <em>trustless</em></h1>
<p>This is not true.</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of trust is required when entering into any business relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client trusts that the contractor will deliver.</li>
<li>The contractor trusts that the client will be able to pay when the job is done.</li>
<li>If there is a dispute, everyone must trust that the courts will resolve it fairly.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Blockchain <em>cannot</em> replace trust</h1>
<p>Successful businesses will always be built upon reputation and personal relationships.</p>
<p>No technology will change this. Blockchain simply offers a new way.</p>
<h1>Smart contracts build trust</h1>
<p>No matter what happens between client and contractor, smart contracts ensure a predictable outcome.</p>
<p>With a client's budget locked into a smart contract, the contractor knows the client is able to pay. If the contractor fails to deliver at a critical checkpoint, the client has the option to cancel the contract and withdraw any budget remaining.</p>
<h1>Trust comes easier</h1>
<p>Smart contracts are permanently recorded on the blockchain. This allows both client and contractor to assess risk by examining their respective contractual track records. Once the terms of a contract are decided, both client and contractor are assured that their interests are protected. The client's investment is locked until the contractor delivers while ensuring the contractor gets paid for work already completed.</p>
