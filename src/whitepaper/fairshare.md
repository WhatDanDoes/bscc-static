FairShare
=========

# What's it all about?

FairShare sets new expectations about work and collaboration.

It is project driven, outcome focused, and designed to produce repeatable results.

Ownership of the final FairShare product rests in the hands of its contributors.

## It's about ownership

FairShare, at its core, is about the opportunity to keep a piece of what you put in.

When you contribute to a FairShare project - whether with money or time - you may claim a share equal with the value contributed.

With your share of a project comes rights to its sale and marketing. You can even permanently sell your shares.

## It's about collaboration

FairShares provide a powerful voice. As a FairShare holder, you are entitled to vote on how to see a project through to completion. You may also delegate authority to an elected board of directors.

FairShare projects set new expectations of organizations and how contributors collaborate.

## It's about incentivizing participation

A contractor working on a FairShare project has no obligation to accept FairShares as payment.

Upon fulfilling a commitment to the DAO, a contractor may take payment in the blockchain's native token, in FairShares, or some percentage of each.

## It's project driven

Every FairShare project is organized as a _Decentralized Autonomous Organization_. With each new project comes a new DAO.

## It's about repeatable results

The FairShare approach to project execution naturally documents workflows. This provides valuable experience when launching similar projects, without binding future decision making.

With each completed FairShare project, whether successful or not, comes a complete record of every conversation that took place.

## It's about optimization

With comprehensive record-keeping comes an opportunity to simplify processes and correct mistakes for when the next FairShare project is launched.

Future FairShare projects are informed by those of the past, but without binding their decisions in the future.
