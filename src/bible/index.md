How does FairShare complete the Race to 2025?
=============================================

My goal is to document the process by which a single verse in the Bible is translated into a language for which no such translation exists. Though this is a research-focused endeavour, it is one that will produce a valuable, freely-available resource. By doing this, grass-roots translation teams will be informed by the success of a past project without being constrained in pioneering their own approach to Bible translation. Future work will focus on hastening the pace of translation projects with ever-improving processes.

Participation in the translation project itself will be incentivized. Everyone involved - financers, contractors, and community members - are to be compensated with intellectual property rights over the completed verse in proportion commensurate with their contribution.


By incentivizing participation, it is my hypothesis that the chosen task will be completed quicker than _traditional_ approaches to Bible translation. We will also discern the true cost of translating a verse, as the value of shares awarded will be pegged at $1/piece.

The hypothesis is to be tested against data translation agencies already possess:

- The general sense of how long it should take to translate a verse of Scripture (knowing that time will vary greatly verse by verse).
- The associated cost of applying their current methods to the task.

# Project Description:

Organizations pursuing the task of translating the Bible are often perceived to be instruments of colonial oppression by the indigineous communities they seek to serve. As such, these communities are unwilling to engage Bible translators in order to protect what remains of their cultural identities: their languages and stories.

At launch, this project will invite an indigenous Canadian community to translate a single verse of Holy Scripture. Participation is incentivized. Community members will have the option to be compensated with cash or shares in intellectual property (IP) rights over the completed verse. Ownership will be commensurate with individual contributions and enforceable through existing international Copyright treaties.

Prescience Labs is perfectly suited for executing this project, as we are a collaborative innovation hub for Bible translation organizations to discover and test new methodologies. We keep an eye toward anticipating and managing the impact of how we invest time and money.

# Goals:

Our primary goal is to protect indigenous IP rights while spurring interest in self-sustaining grass-roots Bible translation projects. The community will take ownership of the project, which is essential for success.

By incentivizing participation, it is our hypothesis that the chosen task will garner more interest and be completed quicker than it would with _traditional_ approaches to Bible translation. We will also discern the true cost of translating a verse through basic accounting of money spent and the value of shares awarded (pegged at $1/piece).

Accounting is a key component to achieving our primary goal. From the ledger that emerges, we will formally document the process by which a verse is translated and will produce a valuable, freely-available procedural resource. In this way, the success of a past project will inform grass-roots translations teams without constraining them in pioneering and documenting their own community-appropriate approach to Bible translation.

It is expected that the pace of translation projects will hasten with ever-improving processes.

# Addendum


Though on the surface this may appear to be about simple documentation and procedure, the long-term goal is to discover what steps in the translation process are _computable_. Bible translators are already looking to techniques developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence to aid in the process. The predominant application of AI in this context is focused on generating Biblical text with statistical machine-learning models. This project is grounded in a different AI field: Multi-Agent Systems. This field sets out to discover how such systems can produce output in greater quantities than the combined effort contributed (i.e., _synergy_). Examining the problem from the perspective of community ownership and incentivisation is a natural application of MAS understanding and a new application of AI principles yet to be pursued in Bible translation.
