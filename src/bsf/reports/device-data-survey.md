# Common Smartwatch Sensors

These are the electronic devices used to collect subject data:

- Accelerometer
  - Tracks the subject's movement in relation to the surface of the earth.
- Gyroscope
  - Device orientation in 3D space. Detects gestures and wrist movements. 
- Magnetometer
  - Direction the subject is facing. A compass.
- Barometric Pressure Sensor
  - Measures the pressure of the earth's atmosphere as experienced by the subject
- Altimeter
  - Determines changes in the subjects height. E.g., as with climbing or descening stairs.
- Ambient Temperature Sensor
  - Senses the temperature of the subject's environment.
- Skin Temperature Sensor
  - Senses the subject's body temperature.
- Heart Rate Monitor
  - How fast is the subject's heart beating?
- SpO2, Oximetry Sensor
  - Determines the concentration of oxygen in the subject's blood.
- Skin Conductance Sensor
  - Used to calculate calories burned.
- GPS
  - Determines the subject's position on the earth.
- Ambient Light Sensor
  - Typically used to adjust display brightness
- Proximity Sensor
  - Allows the smartwatch to know the subject is wearing the watch. Typically used to conserve battery power.
- ECG Sensor
  - Detects electrical impulses emitted by the subject's heart
- Electrodermal Activity Sensor
  - Used in combination with other sensors (e.g., ECG, Skin temperature) to measure the subject's stress levels.
- UV Sensor
  - Measure's ultra violet radiation from the sun
- Bioimpedance Sensor
  - Determines respiratory rate, sleep quality, et al, by measuring electrical resistance in the subject's skin.
- Camera
  - Record video and still images.
- Microphone
  - Record audio data.

I'm not certain that this is a complete list. I am also uncertain as to whether some of the sensors may perform the same function (e.g., bioimpedance and electrodermal sensors).

# Common Health-Related Data Points

These are eight common health monitoring data points offered by smart watches: 

- Heart Rate
- Sleep Quality
- Body Composition
- Active Minutes
- Menstrual Health
- Cadence (for Runners)
- VO2 Max (for Endurance Training)
- Calories Burned for Overall Fitness

# How Much Data do they Collect?

Potentially 2 to 5 GB per day.
