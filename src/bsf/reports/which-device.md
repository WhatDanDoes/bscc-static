Fitness trackers and health-monitoring _smart watches_ are a popular and unobtrusive way to collect information about what's happening in the wearer's body. Through data _analysis_ we gain insight into physiological responses to habit and circumstance. Through data _analytics_ we discover opportunities to realize goals for health and wellbeing.

## Considerations

There is a plethora of wearable computational devices on the market. The researcher must consider many factors when choosing the best tool for the job. The following considerations are not exhaustive. There are likely factors that have yet to be discovered.

### Privacy

First and foremost, the privacy of the research _subject_ must be carefully guarded. The data collected by a wearable computational device rightfully belongs to the person wearing the device. Should the subject decide to supply data for research, it is understood that access to this data is privileged and may be revoked at any time.

Data is a valuable commodity. As such, _privacy_ also pertains to _proprietary_ analytics. Both the data and the methods by which it is handled must remain private.

### Purpose of Study

The needs of an athlete training for the Olympics will likely differ from the needs of a clinician treating a sleep disorder. The physical device is one consideration, while the software method by which data is collected and distributed is another.

For researchers, this consideration is tightly coupled with those pertaining to _privacy_. Where does the data actually go? Who owns it?

One device and API may suit bio-spiritual research, while one may be better suited toward discovering the impact choral participation has on they symptoms of dementia.

### Place of Study

A controlled environment places different demands upon a device than one deployed into the world. The most obvious consideration here concerns network connectivity. A laboratory will have wifi whereas unconstrained day-to-day data streaming requires connectivty to a cellular network.

### Data Granularity

Is data required in a continuous stream, or is it sufficient to tabulate and report on a daily basis? For example, tabulated data may be sufficient for analysis. Or, if not tabulated, _historical_ at least. By contrast, live-stream data may be required to enjoy the assistance potentially offered by an AI. 

### Participant Feedback

Can researchers be satisified with data collection, or do they require the direct participation of a subject or observer? The latter scenario may demand customized software. What steps must be taken to develop an app for any given smart watch?

## Conclusion

There are no shortage of wearable computational devices from which to choose. A typical Google search produces myriad opinion on which device is best for the job:

- [Digital Health Central - Best Smartwatch for Health Monitoring/](https://digitalhealthcentral.com/2022/02/16/best-smartwatch-for-health-monitoring/)

Choosing the best tool requires a clear understanding of the researchers' goals and the context in which the research takes place. Each device has its own strengths and limitations.

With regard to privacy, another conclusion can be drawn: there is proven commercial value in collecting, possessing, and marketing data to the exclusion of intermediary stakeholders. Privacy must be the primary consideration when selecting a device for bio-spiritual data collection.
