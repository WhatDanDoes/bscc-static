# Sometimes people say blockchain is _trustless_

This is not true. There is a tremendous amount of trust involved when in entering into a contract. The client has to trust that the contractor will deliver and the contractor trusts that the client will be able to pay when the job is complete. Should either party fall short of their commitments, all sides must trust that the courts will resolve the dispute fairly.

# Blockchain _cannot_ replace trust

Good business will always be built upon reputation and relationships. Blockchain simply offers another way to build trust. They ensure a predictable outcome no matter what happens over the course of a contract. Clients can trust by the reputation built by successful contractors, and contractors can trust that they will get paid for work completed.

# A new way to build trust

This is all accomplished with _smart contracts_, which are permanentely recorded on the blockchain. The client's budget is locked into a smart contract. The contractor knows the client can pay. If the contractor fails to deliver at a critical checkpoint, the client has the option to cancel the contract and withdraw any budget remaining.
