Sometimes you'll hear people talk about how blockchain is _trustless_. This is not true. There is a tremendous amount of trust involved when in entering into a contract. The client has to trust that the contractor will be able to deliver and the contractor must trust that the client will be able to pay when the job is complete. Should either party fall short of their commitments, all sides trust the courts will resolve the issue fairly.

Blockchain _cannot_ replace trust. Good business will always be built upon reputation and relationships. Blockchain simply offers another way to build trust. They ensure a predictable outcome no matter what happens over the course of a contract. Clients can trust by the reputation built by successful contractors, and contractors can trust that they will get paid for work completed.

This is all accomplished with _smart contracts_, which are permanentely recorded on the blockchain. The client's budget is locked into a smart contract. The contractor knows the client can pay. If the cotractor fails to deliver at a critical checkpoint, the client has the option to cancel the contract and withdraw any budget remaining.
